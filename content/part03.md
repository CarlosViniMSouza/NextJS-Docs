# Data Fetching

Data fetching in Next.js allows you to render your content in different ways, depending on your application's use case. These include pre-rendering with **Server-side Rendering** or **Static Generation**, and updating or creating content at runtime with **Incremental Static Regeneration.**

## getServerSideProps

If you export a function called `getServerSideProps` (Server-Side Rendering) from a page, Next.js will pre-render this page on each request using the data returned by `getServerSideProps`.

## getServerSideProps or API Routes

It can be tempting to reach for an API Route when you want to fetch data from the server, then call that API route from `getServerSideProps`. 

This is an unnecessary and inefficient approach, as it will cause an extra request to be made due to both `getServerSideProps` and API Routes running on the server.

## getStaticProps

If you export a function called `getStaticProps` (Static Site Generation) from a page, Next.js will pre-render this page at build time using the props returned by `getStaticProps`.

## Where can I use getStaticProps
getStaticProps can only be exported from a page. You cannot export it from non-page files.

One of the reasons for this restriction is that React needs to have all the required data before the page is rendered.

Also, you must use export getStaticProps as a standalone function â€” it will not work if you add getStaticProps as a property of the page component.
